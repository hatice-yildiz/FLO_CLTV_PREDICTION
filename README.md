Customer Value = Average Order Value * Purchase Frequency 

We perform all operations based on the Customer Value.

Average Order Value = Total Price / Total Transaction

Purchase Frequency = Total Transaction / Total Number of Customers

Churn Rate = 1 - Repeat Rate

RepeatRate = Number of Customers Who Have Shopped More Than Once/ Total Number of Customers

When grouping is done by sorting according to the CLTV value to be obtained as a result of these processes and dividing from certain points, our customers are divided into segments.
